# SpatialWorkbench
A management application for the SpatialOS development environment

The objective of this application is help with local environment setup, with the ability to configure and validate your setup. For now this isn't concerned with cloud deployment.

As the SpatialOS API changes, as well as worker integrations, this application needs to deal with multiple versions so viewmodels and views should be done with a combination of code generation and reflection to avoid an enormous codebase!
